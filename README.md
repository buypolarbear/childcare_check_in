# childcare_check_in

This assignment was given before the final project to assess our skills and tools covered during the class.
The goal of the childcare check in app is to allow a parent to check in/out their child and also produce a billing report
to the parent when they have time to look over it.
It is designed so that a user can navigate through quickly and painlessly (as if they were running late for work).

# Features:
* Allow a parent to check in a child with a 4 digit pin code.
* Allow a parent to check out a child with the same 4 digit pin code.
* Allow the facility to input new children and associate a 4 digit pin code with them.
* Allow the facility to report how many hours a child has attended day care total.
